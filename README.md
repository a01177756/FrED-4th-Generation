# FrED Factory 4th Generation

  ## FrED Factory Challenge powered by MIT
The challenge is to build a production line where you'll work alongside collaborative robots, program PLCs, HMIs, sensors, and actuators. Your team will be responsible for a part of the manufacturing line where the entire class will ultimately come together to create a FrED device.Â 
We will produce 5 FrED devices and all of the must have some testing!

Get ready to embark on an innovative and exciting manufacturing journey with cutting-edge technology!
